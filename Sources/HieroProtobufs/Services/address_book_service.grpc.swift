///*
/// The Address Book service provides the ability for Hedera network node
/// administrators to add, update, and remove consensus nodes. This addition,
/// update, or removal of a consensus node requires governing council approval,
/// but each node operator may update their own operational attributes without
/// additional approval, reducing overhead for routine operations.
///
/// Most operations are `privileged operations` and require governing council
/// approval.
///
/// ### For a node creation transaction.
/// - The node operator SHALL create a `createNode` transaction.
///    - The node operator SHALL sign this transaction with the active `key` for
///      the account to be assigned as the "node account".
///    - The node operator MUST deliver the signed transaction to the Hedera
///      council representative.
///    - The Hedera council representative SHALL arrange for council members to
///      review and sign the transaction.
///    - Once sufficient council members have signed the transaction, the
///      Hedera council representative SHALL submit the transaction to the
///      network.
/// - Upon receipt of a valid and signed node creation transaction the network
///   software SHALL
///    - Validate the threshold signature for the Hedera governing council
///    - Validate the signature of the active `key` for the account to be
///      assigned as the "node account".
///    - Create the new node in state, this new node SHALL NOT be active in the
///      network at this time.
///    - When executing the next `freeze` transaction with `freeze_type` set to
///      `PREPARE_UPGRADE`, update network configuration and bring the
///      new node to an active status within the network. The node to be added
///      SHALL be active in the network following this upgrade.
///
/// ### For a node deletion transaction.
/// - The node operator or Hedera council representative SHALL create a
///   `deleteNode` transaction.
///    - If the node operator creates the transaction
///       - The node operator MUST sign this transaction with the active `key`
///         for the account assigned as the "node account".
///       - The node operator SHALL deliver the signed transaction to the Hedera
///         council representative.
///    - The Hedera council representative SHALL arrange for council members to
///      review and sign the transaction.
///    - Once sufficient council members have signed the transaction, the
///      Hedera council representative SHALL submit the transaction to the
///      network.
/// - Upon receipt of a valid and signed node deletion transaction the network
///   software SHALL
///    - Validate the threshold signature for the Hedera governing council
///    - Remove the existing node from network state. The node SHALL still
///      be active in the network at this time.
///    - When executing the next `freeze` transaction with `freeze_type` set to
///      `PREPARE_UPGRADE`, update network configuration and remove the
///      node to be deleted from the network. The node to be deleted SHALL NOT
///      be active in the network following this upgrade.
///
/// ### For a node update transaction.
/// - The node operator SHALL create an `updateNode` transaction.
///    - The node operator MUST sign this transaction with the active `key`
///      assigned as the `admin_key`.
///    - The node operator SHALL submit the transaction to the
///      network.  Hedera council approval SHALL NOT be sought for this
///      transaction
/// - Upon receipt of a valid and signed node update transaction the network
///   software SHALL
///    - If the transaction modifies the value of the "node account",
///       - Validate the signature of the active `key` for the account
///         assigned as the _current_ "node account".
///       - Validate the signature of the active `key` for the account to be
///         assigned as the _new_ "node account".
///    - Modify the node information held in network state with the changes
///      requested in the update transaction. The node changes SHALL NOT be
///      applied to network configuration, and SHALL NOT affect network
///      operation at this time.
///    - When executing the next `freeze` transaction with `freeze_type` set to
///      `PREPARE_UPGRADE`, update network configuration according to the
///      modified information in network state. The requested changes SHALL
///      affect network operation following this upgrade.
