        //
        // You can "create" an account by generating a private key, and then deriving the public key,
        // without any need to interact with the Hedera network.  The public key more or less acts as the user's
        // account ID.  This public key is an account's aliasKey: a public key that aliases (or will eventually alias)
        // to a Hedera account.
        //
        // An AccountId takes one of two forms: a normal `AccountId` with no `aliasKey` takes the form 0.0.123,
        // while an account ID with an `aliasKey` takes the form
        // 0.0.302a300506032b6570032100114e6abc371b82dab5c15ea149f02d34a012087b163516dd70f44acafabf7777
        // Note the prefix of "0.0." indicating the shard and realm.  Also note that the aliasKey is stringified
        // as a hex-encoded ASN1 DER representation of the key.
        //
        // An AccountId with an aliasKey can be used just like a normal AccountId for the purposes of queries and
        // transactions, however most queries and transactions involving such an AccountId won't work until Hbar has
        // been transferred to the aliasKey account.
        //
        // There is no record in the Hedera network of an account associated with a given `aliasKey`
        // until an amount of Hbar is transferred to the account.  The moment that Hbar is transferred to that `aliasKey`
        // AccountId is the moment that that account actually begins to exist in the Hedera ledger.
